I am Assistant Professor of Economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences ([LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk)).

I am also a research fellow at the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives ([IDEAS](https://ideaspak.org)), the Mahbub ul Haq Research Centre ([MHRC](https://mhrc.lums.edu.pk)), and the Centre for Water Informatics and Technology ([WIT](https://wit.lums.edu.pk)).

I obtained my PhD in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics and Policy from the University of California, Riverside in 2015 and a BA in Economics-Mathematics and in History from Colby College in 2008.

### Research Fields

I have an active research portfolio in the areas of:

* Environmental and Natural Resource Economics

* Applied Economics

\

### Areas of Inquiry

I seek to understand:

* How policymakers in developing countries can better manage environmental quality and natural resources---especially groundwater---given institutional constraints that economic actors face in low-income settings;

* How provision of information---such as air pollution forecasts, water conservation tips, and firm emissions portfolios---can improve behavioral responses to environmental externalities.

\

### Methods

I rely on:

* Dynamic optimization methods (dynamic programming and optimal control) to solve and simulate hydro-economic models;

* Applied methods (field experiments, lab-in-the-field experiments, and stochastic frontier analysis) based on field surveys to identify causal impacts and mechanisms.

\

### Funding

To support my research, I have raised funds close to $250,000 through grants from organizations such as the International Growth Center and the International Food and Policy Research Institute.
